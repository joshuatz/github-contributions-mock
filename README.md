# github-contributions-mock

## What is this?
Purely for-fun little app / webpage to mock text and/or emoji appearing in a Github "contributions graph". Uses React + JS + HTML + CSS, and also relies heavily on the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to convert text characters into a point array format.

## Demo
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
